# This repository is a collection of classic algorithms implemented in Python.

## Includes a stack data structure.
You may push(val) or pop() items into or off of the stack.

## Includes a linked list data structure.
LinkedList objects include the following methods: insert(val), pop(), size(), search(val), remove(node), and display().

## Includes a doubly linked list data structure.
DoubleLinkedList objects include the following methods: insert(val), append(val), pop(), shift(), remove(val). DoubleLinkedList objects can be instantiated with an optional iterable. Collaborated with Michael Sullivan regarding head and tail sentinals.

## Includes a queue data structure, which is composed from the DoubleLinkedList object. 
Queue objects have these attributes: enqueue(val), dequeue(), peek(), and size(). The head node is not explicitly an attribute.

## Includes a graph data structure.
- add, view, and delete nodes
- add, view, and delete edges
- traverse graph, either breadth-first or depth-first
- determine whether given node exists
- determine whether given nodes are adjacent
- view list of adjacent nodes to given node
- get weight for given edge
